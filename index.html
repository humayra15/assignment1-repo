            <p>
                You are great at what you do. You have a clear roadmap of where you want your career to take you.
                However, even when you have every step, milestone, and promotion mapped out, the reality is that
                advancing doesnot happen overnight, and its common for work energy levels to drop â€” particularly at the
                end of the year. Suddenly things that you took in your stride can feel like a slog and you can get
                bogged down and demotivated. For example, a professional development course you were excited about a
                month ago starts to feel like a drain on your energy, or a work project you felt confident about
                suddenly appears to be overwhelming.
